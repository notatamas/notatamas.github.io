Parkhurst forest is good for a small stroll into where the red squirrel hide is or can become a larger walk if required.
The above picture shows what the forest is like when you wander deliberately off the footpath on a fine bright day,
 it is quite dark and very quiet inside making it quite easy to get lost.
