Luccombe Chine area is situated between Shanklin Old Village and Bonchurch,
however the main road {A3055} which links the two does not go near to Luccombe and the only lane to Luccombe is now Private and not for public use.
There is just a handful of houses, one Hotel and a farm but it does have its own beach and Luccombe is considerably lower than the main road therefore it is easily missed if driving by.
