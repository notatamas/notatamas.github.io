Ventnor Park is situated in a Westerly direction of Ventnor and runs alongside the A3055 road towards St. Lawrence.
It is not a particularly large park but it is well maintained and has a stream with a few stepping stones running through it.
At the start of the park there is a putting green with ice cream and refreshments which is normally open into the evenings during peak season.
Near Park Lodge there is a small bird aviary and not too far away is Ventnor Park's Bandstand which originally belonged to Ventnor's Pier and has been in the park since 1903.
