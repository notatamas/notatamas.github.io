It has 94 steep steps up to the lantern and the height of the tower now is 27 metres.
It was 13 meters higher but due to problems with mist capping the lighthouse it was decided to lower the top tower by 7 meters and the middle tower by 6 meters in 1875.
An accident took place at the station during the Second World War, on 1st June 1943.
A bomb landed directly on the engine house killing the three keepers who were on duty and had taken shelter there.
Their last log can be seen in the log book on show in the lighthouse and a sixty year old Union Jack flag is still displayed on a wall opposite as a mark of respect.
