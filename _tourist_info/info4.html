According to local legend Walter De Godeton took wine washed ashore from a shipwreck in Chale Bay.
The wine came from a French monastery and he was soon found out, he was fined and threatened with excommunication from the church unless he built an Oratory and beacon as a penance for his sins.
It stands on one of the highest hills of The Island.
The Beacon continued to be used to warn ships right up to the 17 Century however it was not very effective due to cloud and hill fog so ships continued to be shipwrecked -
so a new lighthouse was built which is now at St Catherine's and is still operational.
